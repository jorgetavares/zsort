Overview
--------------
zsort is a collection of portable sorting algorithms. Common lisp provides the sort and stable-sort
functions but these can have different algorithms implemented according to each implementation. Also, 
the standard sorting function might not be the best for certain situation. This library aims to provide
developers more options. Although for most situations the standard functions are more than enough, zsort
can be a useful complement. 


Algorithms
--------------
- insertion sort
- quicksort 
- randommized quicksort
- merge sort


How to use
--------------
All sorts have the same syntax (<sort> sequence &key key) and return a sorted sequence. All the 
functions sort destructively, i.e., keep a copy of the unsorted sequence if you wish to keep it.
